 My first memory of “appointment to view” TV is as indelible as it is vivid. It was the final episode of the BBC’s adaptation of John Masefield’s The Box of Delights, which I caught only by imploring my mother to let me stay for another half an hour while visiting a friend. The early special effects in the style of Doctor Who were as stardust to my young eyes; I still recall the thrill of watching Robert Stephens (as the villainous Abner Brown) fall to his watery fate. It wasn’t only the state-of-the-art animation and the compelling performances that captured my imagination, but also the magic of the story.

Some 33 years later, when I found myself writing the first stage adaptation of this extraordinary book – which opens on Friday at Wilton’s Music Hall in east London – I realised quite how pervasive and enduring a spell the story had cast, not only on my imagination, but on a whole canon of childhood classics. In a curious way, Masefield is the unrecognised founding father of our current golden age of children’s literature.


The 15th poet laureate, born in 1878, Masefield grew up in the reign of Queen Victoria, but his final published poem marked the assassination of President Kennedy. Described by his biographer Muriel Spark as a “born storyteller”, he was sent away to sea at the age of 13, where he devoured that other children’s urtext, Treasure Island, on board the merchant ship HMS Conway. Surrounded by characters seemingly drawn straight from its pages, he not only learned how to rig a sail, but also how to spin a yarn.
